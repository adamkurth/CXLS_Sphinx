Introduction
------------

For the uses of CXLS, we have adapted the existing Reborn repository. `Here <https://gitlab.com/kirianlab/reborn>`_ is the hyperlink for this repo. Specifically, this repository is tailored to the uses at CXLS and gathering and analyzing crystallography data. 

Click here to view the documentation for Reborn: `Reborn Documentation <https://kirianlab.gitlab.io/reborn/>`_.

This documentation is still under construction and will be updated regularly.

Troubleshooting DCU Notes
-------------------------

Software:
---------

- Verify that all instructions on `README.md` have been followed, available here: `README <https://github.com/adamkurth/CXLS_Sphinx/blob/main/README.md>`_.

- Verify that the DCU is connected to the network (either via ethernet or wifi)


Hardware:
---------

- Verify that the chiller is running and set to 22Â°C
- Verify that the dry air is flowing (just enough that you can feel it on your lip should be plenty)
- Verify that the blue LED on the power brick is lit
- Verify that the detector's POWER switch is depressed
- Verify that the DCU is powered on and booted, and that the iDRAC LED or display panel do not show any errors
