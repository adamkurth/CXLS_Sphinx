Online Analysis
================

Introduction
------------

This page provides information on how to perform online analysis using CXLS. Online analysis is the process of analyzing data in real-time as it is being collected. This is in contrast to offline analysis, where data is analyzed after it has been collected.

Online analysis is useful for a variety of reasons. For example, it can be used to monitor the quality of the data as it is being collected. It can also be used to perform real-time analysis of the data, which can be useful for making decisions about the experiment.

CXLS provides a number of tools for performing online analysis. These tools are described in detail in the following sections.

Online Analysis Workflow
------------------------

The online analysis workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Step 1: Data Acquisition
    - Collect the data from the desired source.

2. Step 2: Preprocessing
    - Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise and artifacts.

3. Step 3: Feature Extraction
    - Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data.

4. Step 4: Model Training
    - Train a machine learning model using the extracted features.

5. Step 5: Real-time Analysis
    - Perform real-time analysis on new data using the trained model.

6. Step 6: Visualization
    - Visualize the results of the real-time analysis.

7. Step 7: Decision Making
    - Make decisions based on the results of the real-time analysis.

8. Step 8: Data Storage
    - Store the results of the real-time analysis for future use.

AI/ML Data Package 1 (gpCAM)
-----------------------------

The University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee group has developed a data package for online analysis of time-resolved data. This is an adaptation for the uses of gpCAM developed at `Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <https://gpcam.lbl.gov/>`_.

The documentation will be underconstruction. Please refer to the `gpCAM documentation <https://gpcam.lbl.gov/>`_ for the time being.

AI/ML Time Resolved Data Package 
---------------------------------

The AI/ML Time Resolved Data Package is a collection of data and scripts that can be used to perform online analysis of time-resolved data. The data package contains the following files:

- `data/`: A directory containing the data files.
- `scripts/`: A directory containing the scripts.
- `README.md`: A file containing information about the data package.
